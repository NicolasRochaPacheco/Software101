# Software for SoC101 (Software101)

Source code for SoC101 embedded system. This repo is a FreeRTOS port for the SoC101, but it might change in a future. We are currently working on a RV32IV* port for the embedded system. Rather than developing cool software we are focusing in the know-how of getting some C source files into a flash memory in a repeatable way.
